/**
 * The standard renderers request processor. This processor is responsible for
 * handling any viewstate present in the request. It will parse the request,
 * retrieve all viewstates, and start the necessary lifecycle associated with
 * them before continuing with the standard struts processing.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If any exception is thrown during the processing of a viewstate it will be handled by struts like if the exceptions occured in
 * the destiny action. This default behaviour can be overriden by making the destiny action implement the
 * {@link pt.ist.fenixWebFramework.renderers.plugin.ExceptionHandler} interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The processor ensures that the current request and context are available through {@link #getCurrentRequest()} and
 * {@link #getCurrentContext()} respectively during the entire request lifetime. The processor also process multipart requests to
 * allow any renderer to retrieve on uploaded file with {@link #getUploadedFile(String)}.
